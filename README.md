# Mapping_Earthquakes
Using JS and APIs
# Overview
The purpose of this assignment is to read in Earthquake data with d3.json into a working javascript code accessed by a working html link. The completed map has 3 different tile layers; a standard street view, a satelitte view and a dark view. The map itself consists of three overlays. The first is a map showing earthquake data from the past 7 days with circle markers that show the magnitude and location of the earthquake. The second layer shows a view of the tectonic plates around the world and maps them with a line. The third layer shows only the major earthquakes from the past 7 days and shows a circle marker on the map around the large earthquakes.
